[quote, Bran Selic, Using models in real-time software design - 2003]
[...] the inability of real-time software to meet its primary non-functional requirements becomes apparent only in the later
stages of development. When this happens, the design may have to be heavily and hurriedly modified [...]

There are two ways of constructing a software design.
One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies.
And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
