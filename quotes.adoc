[quote, Paul Graham]
A programming language is for thinking about programs, not for expressing programs you've already thought of. It should be a pencil, not a pen.

[quote, Bran Selic, Using models in real-time software design - 2003]
[...] the inability of real-time software to meet its primary non-functional requirements becomes apparent only in the later
stages of development. When this happens, the design may have to be heavily and hurriedly modified [...]

A system is an open set of complementary, interacting parts, with properties, capabilities and behaviours emerging, both from the parts and from their interactions, to synthesize a unified whole.

[quote, C.A.R Hoare, Turing Award Lecture - 1980]
There are two ways of constructing a software design.
One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies.
And the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.
