How to improve:
[{incremental}]
* Understanding your customer needs
** by *interviewing* them regularly
* Understanding what's getting in the way of them being successful
** by analyzing their behavior on your system
* Using that information to drive *prioritization of features*
* Building in *regular feedback loops*
** quantitative and qualitative
** that confirm that our ideas did indeed add value
* Letting the right solutions *emerge from the use* of the system
** Donâ€™t attempt to predict exactly how each interaction will best be served.
** Customer usage of early-stage features informs future iterations of those features.
* Leverage the agility of this way of working to change course
** re-prioritize when the facts disagree with your plan
