=== Setup

Split in groups and in each group design 2 volunteers:

- a "cartoonist" (with minimal talents if possible)
- one student who will play the project owner.

Everybody else will play project supervisors.


=== Let's play

. Cartoonists get out and are briefed by teacher

On a sheet of paper draw:

-    a triangle
-    a square
-    a rectangle
-    a circle
-    a house
-    a tree

There is no constraint on:

-    colors
-    size
-    position
-    etc.

. The project owner discover the drawing and dictate to the project supervisors
what they are supposed to produce (to draw).
This part should only last 3 minutes.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
-    The PS do not see the original drawing.
-    The PO do not see what the PS are drawing.
=====
+
. We compare the original and the PS drawings :-)
. The PS select the best drawing (and send me the picture for my materials)
. The best drawer become PO and we start again with other topics.
