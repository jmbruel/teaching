[{intro}]
== The *SCRUM* agile method

[{incremental}]
- {Scrum} is an *agile* process dedicated to produce the *most client value*
in the *shortest time*.
- *Working* software is produced on every iteration (sprint)
- The client provides *priorities*.

ifdef::slides[== The *SCRUM* agile method]
[{incremental}]
- The team *self-organize* itself to better match client priorities
- At the end of every sprint, everybody can check that the *product runs*
(or not) and decide to deliver a release or not.

ifdef::slides[:leveloffset: -1]

[{topic}]
=== SCRUM roles

The actors in {SCRUM} are:

[{incremental}]
The *Product Owner*:: the client or its representative, who is part of the team
The *SCRUM Master*:: an animator, not a manager
The *Team*:: everybody else, without specific role

ifdef::slides[:leveloffset: -1]

// ------
[{topic}]
==== Product Owner

[{incremental}]
- Define and is responsible of the product's *features*
- Choose the dates and content of the *releases*
- Is responsible of the ROI *return on investment*
- Define  *priorities* in the product backlog
- *Ajust* features and priorities at each sprint (if necessary)
- *Accept* or *reject* results

[{topic}]
==== SCRUM Master

[{incremental}]
- Ensure the *sustainability* of the project
- Help *applying* Scrum values and practices
- Help resolving problems and fight impediments
- Ensure that the team is fully functionnal and *productive*
- Facilitate *cooperation* between team members
- *Protect* the team from outside "noise"

[{topic}]
==== SCRUM Team

[{incremental}]
- 5 to 10 people, preferably fully dedicated to the project only
- All roles and specialities together [detail]#Architecture, design, coding, GIU, tests, etc.#
- Self-organize itself
- Do not change during a sprint

=== The SCRUM process

ifdef::slides[.The Scrum process (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development))]
image::scrum-uk.png[width=100%]

ifdef::slides[=== The SCRUM process]

* Plannification of the following sprint
[{incremental}]
** Selection of product backlog items that will be developed during the sprint
** Definition of the tasks and of the sprint backlog

ifdef::slides[=== The SCRUM process]

* Daily SCRUM (15mn)
[{incremental}]
** or "stand-up" meeting
** what did I do yesterday ?
** what will I do today ?
** is there any particular problem ?

ifdef::slides[=== The SCRUM process]

* SPRINT review (15-30mn)
[{incremental}]
** Presentation of the application to the team or invited people
** team velocity measure

ifdef::slides[=== The SCRUM process]

* Retrospective meeting (15mn)
[{incremental}]
** The team (including client) review its process
** What went well: continued
** What went wrong: let's improve

ifdef::slides[=== The SCRUM process]

* Release planning
[{incremental}]
** Define the items of the *product backlog* that will constitute the release(s)
** Define the number of sprints and the dates of release
** Done before first sprint by estimating team velocity (if unknown)
** Updated at the end of each sprint

[{topic}]
=== The SCRUM artifacts

[{incremental}]
Product backlog:: list of *User Stories* ordered by (client) value
Sprint backlogs:: list of *tasks* to be realized during the sprint to meet the selected features treated for this sprint
Project burndowns:: graphical representation of the team *progress*

ifdef::slides[:leveloffset: -2]

[{topic}]
==== Product Backlog

[{incremental}]
- Provided by the *Product Owner* at the beginning of the project
- Ranked list of requirements (stories) sorted [detail]#by domain importance#
- This ranking can be re-evaluated after each sprint review [detail]#by the Product Owner#
- Stories can be added/removed at each sprint review [detail]#by the Product Owner#


[{topic}]
==== Sprint Backlog

[{incremental}]
- Defined during the sprint planning
- List of tasks corresponding to the selected User Stories treated during the sprint
- Tasks are "weighted" (most often in hours)
- Time estimation of each task is updated at each daily SCRUM
- The definition of these tasks is a kind of collective design

[{topic}]
==== Project Burndowns

- The values of the product backlog items and the estimates of the sprint
backlogs allow to draw a graphical representation of the progress of the project.

ifdef::slides[:leveloffset: -3]

[{topic}]
===== Sprint Burndown

[{incremental}]
- Updated everyday
- Show the remaining efforts

ifndef::slides[.Example of Sprint Burndown (source: http://www.scrum-institute.org)]
image::sprint-burndown.jpg[link="http://www.scrum-institute.org/Burndown_Chart.php",width=40%]

NOTE: the *sprint burndown* can grow if tasks are added or re-evaluated as more costly.

[{topic}]
===== Product (or release) Burndown

- Estimated at each end of sprint and concerns the remaining product backlog

ifndef::slides[.Example of Product Burndown (source: http://www.scrum-institute.org)]
image::productBurndown.jpg[link="http://www.scrum-institute.org/Burndown_Chart.php",width=70%]

NOTE: the *release backlog* is always evolving, hence the curb is not necessary going always down

ifdef::slides[:leveloffset: -2]

[{topic}]
==== Indicators

[{incremental}]
Velocity:: quantity of the product backlog values realised by the team during the sprint
Capacity:: quantity of the product backlog values that will be realized at next sprint

WARNING: The name "velocity" is missleading
