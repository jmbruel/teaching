The use of a management tools is mandatory but the choice is up to each group
({tuleap}, {gitlab}, {redmine}, {zenhub}, {youtalk}, {jira}, {trello}, ...

The only requirements for this tool (or comination of tools) are:

- you should be able to add me as a member of the team (scrum master helpdesk ;-)

Here is an example of steps you could follow:

. Select the tool that best fill your needs
. Connect (icon:users[] all the group members)
. icon:users[] Play with the environment, menus, etc.
. icon:users[] Choose a Scrum Master icon:user-md[] (at least for the first Sprint)
. icon:user-md[] Scrum Master add the other team members in the project,
as well as {jmb} as a Product Owner icon:male[].
. Don't hesitate to use the forum ({telegram}) for general questions that could interest everybody.
