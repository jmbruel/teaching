[{topic}]
=== What is a project ?

[quote, 2014, Wikipedia]
[...] a project is an individual or collaborative enterprise, possibly involving research or design, that is carefully planned, usually by the project assigned team, to achieve a particular aim

// ------
[{topic}]
=== Some facts...

- *Start*: was are the client needs expressed ?

.. specifications,
.. list of expected features,
.. scenarios, use cases
.. ...

- *End*: when is the result product due ?

Avoid to answer : *yesterday!* [detail]#(Otherwise it's not a project anymore, but a rescue plan)#

// ------
[{topic}]
=== ... and in between ?

[{incremental}]
Option 1:: do your best by your own (like in 'DO the sales')
Option 2:: run a process (like in '(RE)DO your passport')
Option 3:: use project management techniques

=== How project management is doing so far ...

[quote, January 2014, Programmez! journal]
___________________________________________
Out of 10, 7 projects are delivered *late or never* !
___________________________________________

ifdef::slides[=== How project management is doing so far ...]

Possible reasons:

[{incremental}]
- client expectations are *vague*
- *over-estimation* of available resources
- latency at the *beginning*
- modification and updates get *lost*
- *overbooked* teams
- *lost of knowledge* during the project
- risks are *badly evaluated*
- meetings are *not productive*

ifdef::slides[=== How project management is doing so far ...]

[quote, Often heard...]
___________________________________________
In any case, it's the development team fault.

// ------
[{topic}]
=== Why is it so hard ?


It should not be so hard:

- The goal and target are well known (provided by the client)
- The target satisfaction is often measurable (assessment)

[CAUTION]
.The problem
====
There is no systematic method that can garanty that a project
team will meet its goals.
====

[NOTE]
.Why ?
====
Because it requires to manage a domain complexity,
a technical complexity and a human complexity,
at the same time, with limited resources (time, money, ...)
====

ifdef::slides[=== Why is it so hard ?]

In fact, the only predictable fact is :

it will be required to *adapt*!

// ------
[{topic}]
=== What is a successfull project ?

[WARNING]
====
A software project will end successfully if the team delivers an
 application that is *reliable*, *robust* and *maintenable* that
 meet the client expectations and need.
====

ifdef::slides[=== What is a successfull project ?]

[{incremental}]
reliable:: behave as expected in the expected conditions
robust:: handle traffic, user mistakes, failures, etc.
maintenable:: require few efforts to evolve

ifdef::slides[== To *produce* applications]

BUILD:: make, {ant}, {maven}, {ivy}, {gradle}, etc.
=>:: we'll see that later (if needed)...
Project Management tools::
- {tuleap}, {redmine}: dedicated tools
- {gitlab} versioning repos using {git}.

=== Waterfall and V Cycle

ifndef::slides[.The waterfall process]
image::waterfall.png[width=70%]

ifdef::slides[=== Waterfall and V Cycle]

The V cycle adopts:

- Cascading *descending* phases for analysis and design
- Followed by an *ascending* for coding, tests and integration.

ifndef::slides[.Typicall V cycle (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-Model)]
image::Vcycle.png[scaledwidth="90%"]

[WARNING]
====
In these kind of projects *success* means
being able to go through the ascending branch of the 'V'
successfully.
====

ifdef::slides[=== Waterfall and V Cycle]

[NOTE]
.If project stops...
====
- No application can be delivered
- At best some modules/classes can be reused
====

[NOTE]
.If project is late...
====
- coding and integration phases are shortened
- delivered product is undertested
====

// ------
ifdef::slides[=== Waterfall and V Cycle]

To summarize:

[{incremental}]
- Cartesian way of reducing complexity
- Test plans are produced in descending phases
- Tests plans are veryfied during ascending phases


ifdef::slides[=== Waterfall and V Cycle]

[CAUTION]
.Well known limitations
====
[{incremental}]
- *absence* of *maintenance* and *evolution* phases
- going back to design is very difficult
- Hard to estimate _a priori_: what is the estimated complexity of the project ?
- Does the delivered *application* conform to its *documentation* (*and vice versa*) ?

====  Let's consider a trivial example

.A web application for managing URLs
====
Develop a *web application* capable of *collecting*
and *displaying* URLs.

===== Cycle 0

Setup of the integration infrastructure

Chosen solution:

- Development langage: `PHP`
- Infrastructure : `LAMP` server

// ------
[{topic}]
===== Cycle 1

Display the collected URLs

Chosen solution:

- The server stores a urls table
- Web page is returned using `GET` and displays urls as a list

// ------
[{topic}]
===== Cycle 2

To collect urls

Chosen solution:

- Web page propose a form to enter new urls

==== Well known benefits

[NOTE]
====
[{incremental}]
- delivers an application that already runs in cycle 1
- manage complexity and integration at each cycle
- can be applied to a new development but also to an evolution
- allows the client to adjust its requirements

===== When it does not work ?

[WARNING]
====
[{incremental}]
- client can't be involved regularly
- the driving of the method is approximative (delays in releases)
- tests are left over
====

// ------
[{topic}]
===== New problems

[WARNING]
====
[{incremental}]
- importance of the initial infrastructure (cycle 0)
- how to automate non regression tests: XP, T/BDD ...
- spaghetti code => refactoring ...
- frequent releases: continuous integration ...
- what about documentation ???

=== V versus W

[NOTE]
.V
====
[{incremental}]
- Requirements
- Specifications
- General and detailed design
- Coding and (unit) testing
- Integration and (integration) testing
- Release
====

ifdef::slides[=== V versus W (suite)]

[NOTE]
.W
====
[{incremental}]
* Cycle 0
* Cycle 1 .. N
[{incremental}]
** chose several features
** ... code/test ...
** release
** adjust expectations
====

// ------
[{topic}]
=== What is important

[{incremental}]
- Plan (more or less) next actions
- Do as planned
- Regularly evaluate progress towards the target


// ------
[{topic}]
=== Evaluate progress towards the target

An important artifact to assess progress: tests!

[CAUTION]
====
Whatever the methodology, the project should address 'unit testing'
and 'integration testing'.
====

[NOTE]
.You should
====
[{incremental}]
- *systematically* write *testing programs*
- execute them *regularly*
