- Personnal Feedback on the experience
- ...

=== Evaluation

NOTE: This is a group evaluation, hence make sure to put the list

You will have to put a PDF report and any other materials you believe usefull

[TIP]
====
Feel free to add a "self-evaluation"
section in your report that self-evaluate those criteria
for your project.
====

== Exam (20%)

=== Topic

This will take the form of a one hour exam on a quizz
with questions taken from the course (about Agile, Scrum, Tests, Build, Continuous Integration, etc.).

=== Evaluation

The quizz will have negative points for bad answers.
Make sure you answer questions you're sure about the answer.

== Bonus (extra 10%)

=== Topic

For those of you who really want a more detailed,
critical view on Agile methods, I advised you to follow
this online MOOC: {agileMoocUrl}

It is a good way of staying in the field between two venues
and to prepare the exam.

=== Evaluation

Proof of success (>60%) should be sent to me by email.
It will count as a bonus in the evaluation.
