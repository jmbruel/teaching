//----------------------------- les 17 signataires ------------------
[{topic}]
== 17 authors

Famous ones:

- Ward Cunningham (Wiki)
- Kent Beck (XP, JUnit)
- Ken Schwaber et Jeff Sutherland ({Scrum})
- Alistair Cockburn

//----------------------------- les 12 principes ------------------
[{topic}]
== The 12 principles

image::12principles.jpg[link="{agileManifesto}",width=90%]

You will find an update version of the principles on Wikipedia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development

ifdef::slides[== The 12 principles (updated)]

. Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software
. Welcome changing requirements, even in late development
. Working software is delivered frequently (weeks rather than months)
. Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers
. Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted
. Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)
. Working software is the principal measure of progress
. Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace
. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
. Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential
. Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
. Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly

Find in those "12 principles":

[{incremental}]
- Which ones are not principles!
- Which ones are in fact *pratices*
- Which ones are in fact *assertions*
- Which one is even wrong!
- Useless repetitions
- Where is test mentioned?

//----------------------------- les "values" ------------------
[{topic}]
== The agile values

General ideas that precede the principles.

ifdef::slides[== The agile values (ctd.)]

From the {agileManifesto}[manifesto] itself:

[{incremental}]
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

[WARNING]

Do not forget the quote that goes with:
[quote,{agileManifesto}]
while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
=====

ifdef::slides[== The agile values (ctd.)]

From the {agileMoocUrl}[Agile MOOC]:

[{incremental}]
- New, reduced role for manager
- No "Big Upfront" steps
- Iterative development
- Limited, negociated scope
- Focus on quality, achieved through testing


//----------------------------- les principes actuels ------------------
[{topic}]
== The principles

Several types:

- Organizational / Managerial
- Technical

ifdef::slides[:leveloffset: -1]

[{topic}]
=== Good NON AGILE principles!

- Process, procedure and methods
- Insist on requirements and their quality

[{topic}]
=== Organizational principles

[{incremental}]
- Put the customer at the centre
- Accept change
- Let the team self-organize
- Maintain a sustainable pace

[{topic}]
=== More Organizational principles

[{incremental}]
- Produce "minimalist" software
** Develop required features
** and only those
** develop only code and tests

TIP: *YAGNI*: **Y**ou **A**in't **G**onna **N**eed **I**t

[{topic}]
=== More Organizational principles: the LEAN view

7 waste of software dev. (M. Poppendieck):
- Overproduction: extra/unused features
- Inventory: partially developed work not released
- Extra processing: unused artifacts
- Motion: seeking information
- Defects: escaped defects not caugth by tests
- Waiting
- Transportation: handoffs

[{topic}]
=== Technical principles

[{incremental}]
* Develop iteratively
** Frequent working iterations
** Closed-window rule
* Treat tests as a key resource
** All tests must pass (regression)
** Test first (TDD)
* Express requirements through scenarios
** User stories

//----------------------------- les "roles" ------------------
[{topic}]
== Roles

* What happens to the manager?
* Scrum Roles
** Product Owner
** SCRUM Master
** Team
* Other roles

ifdef::slides[]

[{topic}]
== icon:question-circle-o[] Exercise

What are the roles of traditionnal team managers?

== Elements of answer

Taken from the {agileMoocUrl}[Agile MOOC]:

- Define goals
- Define deadlines
- Assign tasks
- Provide interface with higher management
- Provide interface with Customer
- Validate requirements
- Decide wheterg goals have been met
- Enforce deadlines
- Coach, mentor
- Enforce rules and methodology

endif::slides[]

WARNING: In Scrum => no manager!

ifndef::slides[:leveloffset: +1]

== The (self-organizing) Team

- Specialists but no specific domain
- Cross-functional: anyone able to take any task
- Select the major goals for the iteration
- Assign tasks
- Demonstrate results

== Product Owner

- Interface with the Customer
- Defines the product features
- Prioritizes features
- Allows release presentation

== Scrum master

- makes sure that the team properly applies the methodology
- ensures that the team is functional
- enables cooperation
- protect the team
- helping remove impediments
